Project Overview
The FCFS (First-Come, First-Served) Scheduling Simulator is a web-based application that demonstrates the FCFS CPU scheduling algorithm in an interactive and visual manner.
It allows users to input process details, calculate Completion Time (CT), Turn Around Time (TAT), Waiting Time (WT), and visualize process execution with a Gantt chart.

Features
Dynamic input of Arrival Time (AT) and Burst Time (BT) for multiple processes.

Automatic calculation of CT, TAT, WT for each process.

Displays average TAT and average WT.

Interactive Gantt chart showing CPU scheduling sequence and idle times.

Built with React.js and Tailwind CSS for responsive UI.
